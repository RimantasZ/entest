# Entest
See examples folder.

## Contributing
Please do not fork! Make a pull request and if it is not obviously bad I will merge it.

I would like to change a lot of things structure-wise, but API will stay the same.

## Run tests
```
python3 entest/cli.py tests/onboarding_api/test_happy_path.py --graph
python3 entest/cli.py tests/onboarding_api/test_happy_path.py
python3 entest/cli.py tests/onboarding_api/test_happy_path.py --env env_name
```
